    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
        This is an experiment in decision-making. Purdue University has provided funds for this research. The
        instructions are simple. If you follow them carefully and make good decisions, you can earn an appreciable
        amount of money. These earnings will be paid to you privately in cash at the end of the experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
        We ask that you not talk with one another for the duration of the experiment. Please turn off your
        cell-phones.
        Do not use e-mail.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the course of this experiment, you will be called upon to make decisions in several periods. The
        experiment is divided into <b>five</b> sequences of periods and each sequence is
        referred to as a <b>cycle</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px">
        <li>At the beginning of a cycle, each participant in this room will be randomly assigned to a <b>set</b>.
        </li>
        <li>In each set there will be <b>seven</b> persons.</li>
        <li>One of the participants in each set will be randomly chosen to be the <span
                style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">observer</span> throughout the whole cycle. The
            other six participants are <span
                    style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">active participants</span>.
        </li>
        <li>If you are an <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">active participant</span>, for the
            whole
            duration of a cycle, you will interact exclusively with the five other
            <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">active participants</span> in your set and
            nobody else. Every <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">active participant</span> in a
            set
            will be given a fixed ID: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.
        </li>
        <li>If you are the
            <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">observer</span> ,
            for the whole duration of a cycle, you will be observing what the other six
            <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">active participants</span> are doing.
        </li>
        <li>You might meet again these participants in the following cycles, but you won’t be able to recognize each
            other because ID numbers are randomly assigned at the start of each cycle.
        </li>
        <li>Your role as the <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">observer</span> or
            <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">active participant</span> in one cycle is not
            dependent on your role in a previous
            cycle.

        <p>In a period, you and your match can make either of two choices, Y or Z. The points you earn in a period
            depend
            upon both the choice you make, and the choice made by your match in that period. As the payoff table above
            indicates, there are four possible outcomes: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>If both of you choose <b>Y</b> this period then: you both earn <b>25</b> points.</li>
            <li>If you choose <b><span style="color: darkred">Y</span></b>this period and your match chooses Z then: you
                earn <b><span style="color: darkred">5</span></b> points, and your match earns <b> <span
                        style="color: darkgreen">30</span></b> points.
            </li>
            <li>If you choose <b><span style="color: darkred">Z</span></b> this period and your match chooses Y then:
                you
                earn <b><span style="color: darkred">30</span></b> points, and your match earns <b> <span

    <h4>Interaction rules <span style="font-size: large">(2/3)</span></h4>
    <p><u>The following rules only apply to <span
            style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">active participants</span>!</u>
    </p>
    <p>The result screen will display the number of points you have earned for the period along with <b>your choice and
        the
        choice of your match</b> . The first column of the ‘Summary of Results’ table contains your past choices. The
        second
        column concerns the choices of your previous matches. Notice that <b>choices in the second column were most
            likely
            made by different persons in different periods. You are not given information on the choices made by the
            other
            four persons in your set</b>. </p>

    <p>At this stage a ball will be drawn from a “virtual” urn containing one hundred balls numbered from 1 to 100. Each
        ball is equally likely to be selected. The computer program will randomly draw a ball and show the number on the
        result screen. If this random number is less than or equal to {{continuation_chance}}, then the cycle will
        continue into the next
        period. If this number is greater than {{continuation_chance}}, then the cycle ends. Therefore, <b>after each
            period there is a {{continuation_chance}}%
            chance that there will be another period of interaction in the cycle and a {{end_chance}}% chance that the
            cycle will
            end</b>. </p>

    <p>Suppose that a number less than or equal to 90 has been drawn. Then you press the “Next” button to proceed.
        You will face the same decisional situation as in the previous period, but <b>with a person selected at random
            from
            the set of <i>active participants</i> you were assigned to</b>. Remember that there are six <b><i>active
            participants </i></b> in each set. </p>

    <p>Before making your choice, you may review all the outcomes in previous periods of the cycle from the “Summary of
        Results” table. The table shows your history and the past choices of the persons who happened to be your match
        in the period. You then choose either Y or Z. Your choice and the choice of your match this period are recorded
        and added to the “Summary of Results” table in the lower portion of your screen. </p>

    <p>If the number drawn is greater than {{continuation_chance}} then the cycle ends. When a cycle ends, you will be
        notified in a new
        screen. There will be a total of five cycles. The rules in the following cycles are the same as in the first,
        but you will interact with different people. More precisely, after each cycle, new sets of individuals will be
        formed. This random assignment does not depend on any previous choices. A participant might interact with a
        person for more than one cycle. In each future cycle, your chance of being selected to be the <b><i>observer</i></b>
        is 1/7,
        whereas your chance of being selected to be an <b><i>active participant</i></b> is 6/7. </p>

    <p>In each <b>period</b> of a cycle:

    <li>You will not interact with <b><i>active participants</i></b>.</li>
    <li>You get {{Constants.observer_payoff}}</li>

    <p>
        When all the six <b><i>active participants</i></b> made their decisions and reach their result page, you will
        have at most 30

    <h3>Earnings</h3>
    <p>The points you earned in each period are summed up at the end of the experiment. For every 100 points that you
        earn you will receive 1 dollar ($1.00). Therefore, the more points you earn the more money you earn. In
        addition, you will receive a $5 show-up fee. You will be paid your earnings in cash and in private at the end of
        today’s session.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Final Comments</h3>
    <p>
        First, do not discuss your choices or your results with anyone at any time during the experiment.
    </p>

    <p> Second, your ID# is private. Do not reveal it to anyone. </p>

    <p>Third, since there is a {{continuation_chance}}% chance that at the end of a period the cycle will
        continue. However, since the stopping decision is made randomly, some cycles may be much longer than 20 periods
        and some others may be much shorter. </p>

    <p>Fourth, if you are an <b><i>active participant</i></b> , remember that after each period you will be matched
        randomly to someone
        in the set you were assigned to. As there are six <b><i>active participants</i></b> in the set, the probability
        of you being
        matched with the same person in two consecutive periods of a cycle is 1/5. You are not told the identity of your
        match. </p>

    <p>Fifth, if you are <b><i>the observer</i></b>, your role is fixed within a cycle.</p>

    <p>Sixth, the rules are the same in all five cycles. After a cycle, your chance of being an <b><i>active
        participant</i></b> is
        6/7 while your chance of being <b><i>the observer</i></b> is 1/7.</p>
